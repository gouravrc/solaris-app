# ‚ÄºÔ∏è Disclaimer ‚ÄºÔ∏è
The following information is provided for the purpose of sharing specific details relevant to this project. While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information, it is shared with the understanding that there may be omissions. Please see as below:
1. Since, I am using GCP Firebase for cloud integration in my project, I have to create ```serviceAccount.json``` file from firebase console and consume it in our Java application. As this file contains extremely confidential infomation which contains private keys and account information. The information in the file is ommited from the `slr-spring-backend-app/src/main/resources/serviceAccount.json`. You can create your serviceAccount.json by following below steps
    ```
    a. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
    b. On the top left there is a blue "create credentials" button click it and select "service account key." (see below if its not there)
    c. Choose the service account you want, and select "JSON" as the key type
    d. It should allow give you a json to download
    e. Copy and paste in the following path slr-spring-backend-app/src/main/resources
    ```

2. For simplicity, the Python model has not been deployed as a REST API. Initially, the plan was to deploy it using Flask and connect it with our Java REST API using RestTemplate. However, due to time constraints, the focus has been on building the prototype to demonstrate the application's real-time functionality and provide tangible outputs. Nevertheless, the model can still be run as a standalone application. We have mocked the python model response in 

    ```
    slr-spring-backend-app/src/main/java/com/gouravrc/solaris/service/ApplicationOfficerService.java
    ``` 

    Line number 235. method ```getSolarPredictedValue()``` [Click here to jump in](https://github.com/gouravrc/solaris-app/blob/main/slr-spring-backend-app/src/main/java/com/gouravrc/solaris/service/ApplicationOfficerService.java#L235)

3. I have mocked the location details and embeded inside Java application `slr-spring-backend-app/src/main/resources/mock_weather.json` [Click here to jump in](https://github.com/gouravrc/solaris-app/blob/main/slr-spring-backend-app/src/main/resources/mock_weather.json)

4. In order to run the application locally, you need to start springboot server first to run the API service in `localhost:8080`, then you `npm run start` the UI application.
